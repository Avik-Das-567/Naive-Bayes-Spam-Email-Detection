## What is Naive Bayes?
* **Definition:** Naive Bayes is a **machine learning algorithm** that uses **probability** to **predict categories** (like Yes/No or Spam/Not Spam).
* **Real-Life Example Sentence:** Just like we say ‘most emails with **Buy Now** are spam,’ Naive Bayes looks at **words in text** and uses chances to decide if it’s spam or not.
## Objective
* Detecting Spam Email Based on Message Text
## How it Works
* It converts **text into numbers** using `CountVectorizer`.
* Then it calculates **probability** of a message being spam.
* Naive Bayes is called "naive" because it **assumes each word is independent**, even though they’re not.
